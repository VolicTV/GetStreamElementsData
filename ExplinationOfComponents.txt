---Explanation of Each Component---

1.bot.py: This is the main script that will run your bot. It will handle the connection to Twitch and manage the command processing.
2. config.py: This file will store your API keys, channel name, and other configuration settings. It’s a good practice to keep sensitive information out of your main code.
3. requirements.txt: This file will list all the Python packages your project depends on. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. api/: This directory will contain scripts that handle interactions with the different APIs (Twitch, Stream Elements, Google Sheets). Each API will have its own file for better organization.
5. commands/: This directory will contain scripts for the commands your bot can execute. You can separate basic commands from more advanced ones for better organization.
6. utils/: This directory will contain utility functions, such as logging, that can be used throughout your project.

---Next Steps---
1. Set Up Your Environment: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies.
2. Create the Project Structure: Create the directories and files as outlined above.
